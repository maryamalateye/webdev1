          <h3>Yamaha P45</h3>
          <p class="col-6"><br>The Yamaha P45 is one of the best-selling digital pianos for beginners for very good reason. Yamaha products are of amazing quality all-around and this piano is no exception! The P45 is an 88-key weighted piano with graded hammer action and has 4 levels of touch-sensitivity. It features 10 playable sounds and includes a metronome, and transpose and tuning functions! In addition, it also allows for reverb in playing and has a USB port that allows for MIDI playing. The P45 is also a pretty model and weighs fairly little, so it is very easily portable and can be taken on the go. <br><br><br>

          <h3>Thomann DP26</h3>
          <p class="col-6"><br>The Thomann DP26 is a great digital piano produced by Thomann. These pianos are a full 88-key keyboards that are weighted and replicate hammer action that is present in acoustic pianos, allowing for authentic piano playing. Because the keys are weighted, playing on this piano is touch-sensitive much like a real piano, as opposed to other digital pianos within the same price-range. Although the DP26 does not have as many features as other higher-end digital pianos, it has more than enough for the average player. It is a good piano for people interested in playing classical music, as well as other genres like pop and jazz. The DP26 can be bought with a matching stand that is made for it and gives it a classier look. Overall, for the price and all its features, this is a great piano!<br><br><br>
